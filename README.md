The Attendance Management System is a role-based web
							application designed to efficiently manage and track student
							attendance in an educational institution. The system supports
							three primary roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student, each with
							specific access and responsibilities. Admin can add teacher and
							view Student records. Teacher can add Students and manage student
							record and Student can view records only.
